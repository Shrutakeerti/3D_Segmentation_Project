# 3D Segmentation of Abdominal Organs using VNet

## Overview

This project aims to develop a 3D segmentation model to accurately segment abdominal organs (Liver, Right Kidney, Left Kidney, and Spleen) from CT scans. The model leverages the VNet architecture, optimized for 3D medical image segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7860267). It comprises CT scans and corresponding segmentation masks for various abdominal organs.

### Classes and Labels

- **1:** Liver
- **2:** Right Kidney
- **3:** Left Kidney
- **4:** Spleen

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D_Segmentation_Project.git
